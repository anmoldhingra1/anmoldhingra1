I build AI systems that ship to production.

[Rerato](https://rerato.com) is an AI App Factory — we take AI-native applications from concept to launch. Our first product, [Trivana.ai](https://trivana.ai), brings personality-driven AI digital hosts to live experiences.

A decade across the full AI stack — NLP, voice AI, graph ML, deep learning, and MLOps infrastructure at enterprise scale. I've built systems that process real-time conversation streams, model emotional context, and maintain consistent AI personas across sessions.

Open-source work here spans voice persona design, LLM evaluation, conversational emotion analysis, and speaker diarization.
